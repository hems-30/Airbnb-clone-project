### üß© Why Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup Matters

Understanding the color styles and typography from a Figma design ensures visual consistency across your application. These properties act as the **visual language** of your product, supporting brand identity and enhancing usability. 

When you identify and follow the design properties:
- Developers can accurately implement the intended visual experience.
- Teams work faster with shared design tokens and component styles.
- The user experience becomes seamless across devices and pages.
- Future design updates are easier to manage and scale.

Following mockup properties avoids guesswork, supports responsive design, and creates a polished, professional interface.
